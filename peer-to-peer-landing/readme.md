How Do Peer-to-Peer Lending Platforms Work?
Borrowers supply their desired loan amount and relevant details like age, employment, current income, current loans, credit score, average monthly bank balance, salary schedule for the last six months, any inquiries or defaults on their accounts in the last twelve months, their reason for borrowing, intention to pay, etc.
Investors register by filling in relevant details, including the total amount they want to invest. Note that they need to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer), KYB (Know Your Business), and tax regulations. KYC is a process, widely used by financial institutions, that obtains brief information about the identity of a borrower/customer.
The portals screen borrowers’ profiles and assign them risk ratings (A to F; A stands for best rating, and F stands for worst) based on their current and recent past financial statistics and their borrowing requirements.
Portals may also decide loan tenures and interest rates; these are primarily based on customers’ risk ratings.
Borrowers’ loan requests (let’s call them “loan tickets” from now on) are listed (shown on the portal) only after the screening process for that customer is complete.
Registered investors can view listed loan tickets and their associated risk ratings, borrowing requirements, and other relevant details. These help them to make a decision on their investments.
To fulfil a loan ticket, investors can contribute any amount, from the portal’s minimum (say $50) to the total loan amount.
Once a loan ticket is fulfilled, the investors that have contributed to the loan ticket have to release funds to the borrower. Usually, all lending site financial transactions use escrow accounts.
Once the loan amount is disbursed, borrowers repay the amount in the form of EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments). EMIs are collected in escrow accounts and are eventually distributed back to investors based on their shares in the loan ticket.
EMI payments include contributions towards both the loan principal and the interest. In the initial stages, interest payments constitute the major part of the EMI.
There are two possible loan scenarios: borrowers pay some or all the outstanding amount upfront or EMI payment are delayed. These delays can be anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months. If payments are delayed, borrowers are subject to additional interest and a penalty on defaulted EMIs.
If borrowers pay part of an outstanding loan amount, it is distributed amongst investors based on their shares in the loan ticket.
